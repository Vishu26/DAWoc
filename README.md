# Neural Machine Translation with Attention Mechanism

This project aims to create language to language translation standalone application.

# Tools
  - Python
  - Deep learning libraries - Tensorflow or Keras
  - Gui library - QT

# Idea

  - The Translation Machine uses an Encoder-Decoder architecture which are made of Recurrent Neural Networks.
  - Attention Mechanism will help the model to efficiently handle large sentences.
  - Basic Building Block - LSTM(Long Short Term Memory) cell or GRU(Gated Recurrent Unit) cell
